# This wasnt much harder except that I am definetely not counting
# Just simultaneous equations

# x(41777096-x)=249136211271011
# -x^2+41777096x-249136211271011=0
# Quadratic formula gives:
# x = ~7206617
# x = ~34570479
# Since 7206617 is the lower bound, it will most likely contain a decimal, so round up to 7206618
